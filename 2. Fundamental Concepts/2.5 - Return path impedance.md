The path taken by the return current is of utmost importance to the effectiveness of the grounding scheme. In many cases, multiple return paths will be available.
## Path of least impedance
It is well known that most current flows through the path of least resistance at low frequencies and DC. In practice this path is usually also the _shortest_.
At higher frequencies, however, the current will flow through the path which minimizes the inductance, i.e., the _path of least impedance_.
## EMI
To minimize the EMI generated by the circuit, the inductance of the return path should be small. If this is not the case, significant HF voltages will be generated across the return impedance, leading to interference.

On a PCB, the principle of least impedance means the return current will prefer to flow underneath the trace carrying the forward current. The loop area can be made very small by properly designing the stackup to minimize the distance between the forward trace and return plane.
