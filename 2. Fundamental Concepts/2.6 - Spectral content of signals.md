The spectral content of signals can be described using Fourier series (for periodic signals) or the Fourier transform (for aperiodic signals). Essentially, the signal is decomposed into a (continuous or discrete) basis consisting of sinusoidal waveforms with frequencies ranging from DC to $\infty$.

Most of the high-frequency spectral content of a signal is related by the rise/fall time and high-frequency ringing. Therefore, it is important to not make signals _faster_ than they have to be.

Ringing will add high-frequency components to the spectrum and can significantly increase the bandwidth of the signal.
