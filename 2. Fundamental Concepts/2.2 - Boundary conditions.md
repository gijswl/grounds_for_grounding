Boundary conditions are required to give a unique solution to Maxwell's equations (like any differential equation). In electromagnetic field theory, these describe the behaviour of the fields at the interfaces between materials.

Besides being required mathematically, the boundary conditions give rise to important topics for EMC and grounding, such as image theory, flux cancellation, and electromagnetic shielding.
