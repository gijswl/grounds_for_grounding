Common-mode and differential-mode noise may radiate by exciting loops (DM) or mono/dipoles (CM).

## DM emission from small loops
Considering an electrically small loop (e.g., on a PCB), it can be shown that emissions from the loop are proportional to:
- The amplitude of DM (noise) current $i_{DM}$
- The area of the loop $A$
- The frequency $f^2$
DM emissions can be minimized by _flux cancellation_, which occurs when two opposite currents flow in close proximity. This is results essentially from the reduction of the loop area and is easier to achieve in balanced circuits.
## CM emission from small dipoles
If a CM voltage is applied to a conductor (monopole) with respect to a metallic reference plane, this conductor will be mirrored through the reference plane and form a dipole antenna. The emissions from this dipole are proportional to:
- The amplitude of the CM (noise) current $i_{CM}$
- The length of the conductor
- The frequency $f$

Routing traces or wires close to a metallic surface will reduce radiation due to flux cancellation both in differential- and common-mode noise.

In reality, the antennas may be electrically large (comparable to the wavelength). In that case the presented relations may not hold: they are only a rough approximation.
