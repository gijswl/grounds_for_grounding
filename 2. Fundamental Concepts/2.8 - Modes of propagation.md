In case of a two-conductor transmission line, its behavior can be analyzed using only the characteristic impedance $Z_0$, which expresses the ratio between the voltage and current flowing through the line (or electric and magnetic field).

When analyzing a three conductor transmission line, e.g. a shielded twisted pair or a coupled differential microstrip, there are three impedances that characterize the transmission line: characteristic impedance $Z_0$, even-mode impedance $Z_{0e}$, and odd-mode impedance $Z_{0d}$. 
The odd- and even-mode excitations are demonstrated in the figure. The corresponding impedances consider only one of the two lines, whereas common- and differential-mode consider both lines.

Regardless of the geometry, the following relations hold.
$$\begin{align}
	Z_0 & = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} = \sqrt{Z_{0e} Z_{0d}} \\
	Z_{dm} & = 2 Z_{0d} \\
	Z_{cm} & = \frac{1}{2} Z_{0e}
\end{align}$$
Coupling between the lines will increase the common-mode impedance and decrease the differential-mode impedance.
