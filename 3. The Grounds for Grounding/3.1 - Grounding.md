Grounding and earthing have many, potentially conflicting, definitions depending on the engineer. Proper definitions are:
- _Ground_: a generic term to be avoided, unless used together with a specifier (for example, _safety ground_)
- _Reference_: a system of conductive path acting as common reference. It is designed to minimize noise-induced voltages and ensure proper operation of the system.
- _Signal return_: a current return path between the load and signal source.
- _Earth_: the conductive mass of the earth, conventionally considered an equipotential surface.
Various markings are available to indicate ground terminals. IEC 60417 specifies the following symbols.

Other symbols may be used in circuit diagrams to indicate signal ground/return, usually a bar or inverted triangle, potentially with indications for analog, digital, power, etc.
## Grounding myths
1. __Current goes to ground__. Current flows in loops and may flow through the grounding system in an unexpected way if that happens to be the path of lowest impedance. The ground symbol on circuit diagrams is _not_ and infinite current sink!
2. __Grounding reduces touch and step voltage to a safe value__. Although the ground connection itself may have a low impedance, the resistance of adjacent soil layers is not negligible.
3. __Add more earth electrodes to be safe__. If a single earth electrode is not sufficient to obtain the required earth resistance, it is common to place more electrodes close to the original. This reduces the effectiveness of the electrodes. For optimum effect, they should be spaced apart by at least 2.2$\times$ the length of the electrode.
4. __Earth electrodes keep us from getting shocked__. Earth electrodes do not protect us from ground faults. Instead, equipment should be properly bonded to the main distribution panel with adequate circuit breakers and GFCI's. 
5. __Transient current in grounding conductors causes interference to equipment__. Interference may couple onto the grounding system, which is usually specified in terms of DC resistance (not taking into account the very important AC impedance). The resulting voltages can interfere with equipment operation. However, because the protective earth is only required to ensure personal safety, the system should not rely on it for functional reliability.
6. __Different currents flow through different paths__. Although we can give return traces different names on a circuit diagram, the electrons flowing through them do not know to keep clear of each other if they are connected to a common structure.
7. __Electricity takes the path of least resistance__. Current flows through all paths and favours those of least impedance. The current distribution is therefore frequency-dependent.
8. __Common, ground, and neutral are equivalent__. Common and neutral refer to one side of a transformer and are not inherently grounded. Any point on the equipment may be grounded.
9. __Tie neutral and ground together in multiple places__. Neutral and equipment ground should be connected to each other only at the main distribution panel. Otherwise the protective equipment ground would carry a part of the neutral current.
10. __Single-point grounding is necessary__. Single-point grounding cannot be effective over a large area. Therefore, it is recommended to provide a common bonding network to reduce noise. The bonding network may be connected to earth at one or many points (e.g., building steel).
11. __Safety regulations may be compromised to improve equipment performance__. Safety should be the primary consideration and must never be compromised.
