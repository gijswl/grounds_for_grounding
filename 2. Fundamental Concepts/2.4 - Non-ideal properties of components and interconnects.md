Practical components have non-ideal properties related to their physical construction, which may lead to issues with EMC, cross-talk, and signal and power integrity.
## Resistors
A practical resistor has a series inductance (ESL) and parallel capacitance due to its physical construction and connecting leads.  At high frequencies the resistance itself will also increase due to the skin effect.
Wire-wound resistors are unsuitable for HF applications, whereas small SMD carbon film resistors can behave well up to RF.
## Capacitors
Capacitors have series inductance (ESL) and resistance (ESR) due to the connecting leads. The capacitive element itself is also effected by leakage and dielectric losses, both of which can be modeled as a parallel resistance.
HF performance is limited for capacitors with high values of capacitance: typically electrolytic and tantalum. Film and ceramic capacitors are much more suited to HF applications.

Parallel resonance may occur when paralleling capacitors of different values/sizes/technologies. If the capacitors are exactly equal, the impedance is $\frac{1}{n}$ over the entire frequency range due to a reduction in ESL by mutual inductance between the capacitors.
## Inductors
Inductors exhibit series AC resistance due to skin and proximity effects in the windings, parallel interwinding capacitance, and parallel resistance modeling magnetic core losses. The AC resistance and core losses determine the "sharpness" or Q factor at the resonant peak.

## Interconnects
Interconnects, such as PCB traces and wires, have series resistance, inductance, and parallel capacitance, conductance, which influence the frequency characteristics. Self-resonances may occur at which the interconnect is an efficient radiator.

When the interconnect is shorter than $\lambda/10$, it can be modeled as lumped circuit. At higher frequencies, however, the interconnect turns into a transmission line. At this point, transmission line effects must be considered in the analysis.
