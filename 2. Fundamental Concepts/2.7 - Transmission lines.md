A transmission line is a structure designed to guide electromagnetic waves. EM waves may propagate along transmission lines in many modes, the most common of which is TEM (EM field transverse to direction of propagation).

As discussed before, even structures that are not specifically designed for this purpose can _act_ as transmission lines, but usually have inferior performance.
When the length of a conductor exceeds $\lambda/10$, transmission line effects start to occur.
## Transmission line theory
An infinitesimal segment of a TEM transmission line can be modeled using Heaviside's model ($R, L, G, C$).

The wave propagating down the transmission line has a propagation coefficient $\gamma$.
$$\gamma = \alpha + j\beta = \sqrt{(R + j\omega L)(G + j\omega C)} \approx j\omega\sqrt{L C} \qquad \beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \frac{2\pi f}{v}$$
were $\alpha$ is the attenuation constant, and $\beta$ is the phase velocity. The characteristic impedance $Z_0$ of the transmission line describes the ratio $\frac{V^+}{I^+}$ when there are no reflections.
$$Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{R + j\omega L}{G + j\omega C}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$$
## Impedance transformation

## Reflections
If the load of a transmission line is not matched to its characteristic impedance, reflections will occur with a magnitude determined by the mismatch:
$$\Gamma_L = \frac{V^-}{V^+} = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}$$
In case of an open or short circuit no power can be delivered to the load, so the full wave must be reflected. Only the phase is different.
$$\begin{align}
	Z_L \to \infty & \implies \Gamma_L = 1 \\
	Z_L \to 0 & \implies \Gamma_L = -1 \\
\end{align}$$
Reflections cause standing waves on the line with voltages that may be up to twice the source voltage.
