The main objectives of grounding are:
1) Safety grounding
2) Signal grounding
3) Electromagnetic interference control
## Electrical safety grounding
Electrical safety is the most important objective of grounding, and is applied for the prevention of electrical hazards (electric shock, risk of fire, and equipment damage). Safety grounding has three goals:
1) To limit the voltage due to lightning, line surges, and unintentional contact with high-voltage lines.
2) To stabilize voltages and provide a reference for the power grid.
3) To provide a low-impedance path, which facilitates the operation of overcurrent and protective devices (such a residual current devices).
### Power fault hazards
If a live wire were to make contact with the metallic enclosure of some equipment, this would constitute a touch hazard, since lethal current could flow through the human body. The electrical safety ground ensures the metallic enclosure is always at ground potential.
The effectiveness of the safety ground depends mostly on its (DC) resistance.

In the event that the safety ground should become disconnected, leakage current to ground (i.e., current from line to ground through leakage reactance or Y-capacitors) will raise the potential of the enclosure, again causing a safety hazard. For this reason, limits are imposed on the leakage current.
### Lightning protection systems (LPS)
Lightning-induced surges (associated with very large currents and $di/dt$) may enter equipment through cables, antenna interfaces, or power lines. Therefore, the LPS must contain a controlled low-impedance path for the energy to be dissipated to the earth electrode system, diverting them from sensitive systems. 
Ground potential differences can also be harmful to humans (step voltage) and equipment operation. Side flashes may occur between the LPS conductor and grounded objects in the building. Due to the large energy associated with a lightning strike, all conductors and bonding must endure high instantaneous temperature rises.

The spectral content of a typical lightning strike reaches approximately 1 MHz (standardized 1/50 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ impulse). Therefore, both the resistance and inductance must be minimized.
